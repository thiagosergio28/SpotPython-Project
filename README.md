#### It's a project that started in 2022

It's a simple Python program about playing songs, in your way. You're in the control (if you want)!
You can control when Pause a song or Resume it again and make your own playlist! Beyond that, the program have an automatic option, which can play your playlist without asking you if you want to skip, pause or resume the song. It just goes playing the songs in alphabethical or random order!
Enjoy it!
